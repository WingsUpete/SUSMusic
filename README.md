Building a social music app coupled with SUSTech's own features.

This was previously a DBSP (Database System Principles) course project in 2019, the original goal was to build a social music application similar to current popular music apps such as NetEase Cloud Music and QQ Music. However, these existing applications already possess a wide variety of user services and activities so that our former ideas are no longer "innovative".

More details need to be discussed as a result.
